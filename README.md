In this notebook, I used  SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

I worked with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

I used techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
